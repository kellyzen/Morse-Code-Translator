# Morse Code Translator (MATLAB)

This MATLAB project is a simple Morse code translator that converts text into Morse code and vice versa. Morse code is a system of representing text characters as sequences of dots and dashes (or short and long signals), making it suitable for encoding and decoding messages.

## Functions

1. Translate from alphabets to morse code
2. Translate from morse code to alphabets
3. Play the morse code in blinking lights
4. Change theme colour, font size

## Example

Let's say you want to translate the text "HELLO" to Morse code. Here's how you can do it:

1. Run the `morse_code_translator.m` script.
2. Enter "HELLO" when prompted.
3. The script will display the Morse code as follows: ".... . .-.. .-.. ---"
